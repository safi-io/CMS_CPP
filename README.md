# Contact Management System (CMS)

Welcome to the Contact Management System (CMS), a simple C++ application designed to manage contact information. This system allows users to add new contacts, display all contacts, and search for specific contacts by phone number.

## Introduction

The CMS application is a console-based program that provides basic contact management functionalities. It reads and writes contact information to a `data.csv` file, allowing for persistent storage and retrieval of contacts.

## Features

- **Add Contact**: Input and save new contact details including name, phone number, address, and description.
- **Show All Contacts**: Display all contacts stored in the system.
- **Search Contact**: Search for a specific contact by phone number.

## File Structure
- **cms.cpp**: Main program file containing the implementation of the contact management system.
- **data.csv**: A CSV file that stores the contact information (created automatically by the program).

## Dependencies
- This project requires a C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. There are no additional libraries needed beyond the C++ Standard Library.
